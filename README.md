Asimot is an iPad POS system that offers grocery, ice cream shop and online enterprise solutions. It is fully mobile, so you can monitor inventory from anywhere in the store, display photos and details of the product to customers, and ring up orders and accept payments on the sales floor or, for ice cream shops, tableside.
